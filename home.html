India is the largest democratic country. It is a big country divided into 29 states and 7 union territories.<br />
These states and union territories have been created so that the government can run the country more easily.<br />
India also has many different kinds of physical features in different parts of the country that are spread over its states and union territories.<br /> 
India is a very diverse country as well, which means that the people around the country are different in many ways.<br /> 
Even though India is such a diverse place, it is united as one country. 
The term 'secularism' is followed in the democratic state of India, where all the citizens are treated equally.<br />
A political party is a group of people who want to achieve common goals and control the government by winning elections and exercising political powers.<br /> 
India has a multi-party system. It has a huge population. Thus, the size of the huge electorate mandates the elections be conducted in number of phases.<br />
